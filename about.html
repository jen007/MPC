        <p>Micaela’s Produce Center began with founder Micaela Felipe and co-founder Marcos Reynoso.
                Micaela's Produce Center is the retailer of premier-quality fruits and vegetables. When
                Micaela Felipe and her husband, co-founder, Marcos Reynoso created the company in 1998,
                they envisioned a greater community with premier quality foods. Micaela’s Produce Center
                provides high-quality fruits and vegetables for their customers and exemplary customer
                service. The company currently has 2 different locations and holds a vision of expanding
                more in the future. Micaela’s Produce Center has an open floor plan to allow customers to
                walk around and view all the products available and employees are on standby to answer any
                of their questions or concerns. The founders of the company make all designs related to
                the company and run the day-to-day operations of both locations. The founders personally
                communicate with supplies to ensure the quality of the products meets safety standards and are of the freshest
                quality.</p>
